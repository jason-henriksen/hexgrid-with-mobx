# hexgrid-with-mobx

This is a response to a mobx help request.

The user wanted an existing example converted to use MobX instead of setState.

The original example is here:
https://github.com/Hellenic/react-hexgrid/blob/master/examples/templates/src/App.js

The converted version is in src/App.js of this repo.

(If anyone knows a good way to present a diff in this readme.md, I'd love to learn how to easily do that)
